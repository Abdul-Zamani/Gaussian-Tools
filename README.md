**ExtractMOCoeff-AOOvlp**
is a python program that extracts MO matrices from fchk or fmat files and calculate SVD.

**Plots-Logfiles**
is a python program that plots the SCF, DIIS Error and RMSPD versus SCF iterations of different log file and overlap the graphs into one plot if the directory multiple has multiple log files.
